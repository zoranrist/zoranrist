Then try to change some values inside this newly created complex data structures with this sintax:

    For the object:

    For the array:
    NewArray[index] = some value; (NewArray is the newly created array after the assignment expression)

// Reassign reference type example

/*
let obj = { first: 'reference' };

obj = { second: 'ref2' }
